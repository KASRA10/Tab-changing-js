JavaScript functions are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task. They are reusable code snippets that can be called from anywhere in a program. Functions can take input parameters, process them, and return a value or perform an action. JavaScript functions are used to organize and simplify code, reduce redundancy, and make it easier to maintain and update. They can be defined using the function keyword and can be invoked using their name followed by parentheses. Functions are a fundamental concept in programming and are used extensively in web development to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.
